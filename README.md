## Branch Information
### main Branch
This branch contains the design submitted to client and is fabricated for testing. Firmware team should use this design for referencing with the board.

### Evaluation Branch
This branch contains the changes currently in progress. After the design is produced and fabricated, this branch will also contain corrections applied that are observed during testing of the hardware.

### Hardware-Prototype-v.3.2 Branch
This branch is referenced from Evaluation-TLE5012B branch. It will contain the final revisions / corrections needed in the hardware.

### Evaluation-TLE5012B Branch
This branch contains the changes currently in progress. After the design is produced and fabricated, this branch will also contain corrections applied that are observed during testing of the hardware. This is an extended branch of Evaluation that has TLE5012B as the magnetic encoder instead of AEAT-8800 chip.

### Hardware-Prototype-v.1 Branch
This branch contains design files for the last set of prototypes that failed to work due to noise issues.
